<p>As of June, Hawaii became the first state to make a commitment to 100% renewable energy. The state&#8217;s goal is to reach this commitment by 2045. With four solar projects approved by the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (PUC), according to a report from Fierce Energy, the Aloha State is on its way to reducing its nonrenewable energy sources by 80%. Hawaiian Electric has gotten permission from the PUC to speed up the normal procurement process. The PUC has limited its risk by spreading the projects across four vendors and prohibiting additional payments from taxpayers if the projects do not qualify for tax credits.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.huilab.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Blog-7-Pic.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-366" src="http://www.huilab.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Blog-7-Pic-300x200.jpg" alt="Blog 7 Pic" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>A new article highlights growing concerns of privacy violations that will accompany &#8216;smart&#8217; cities. While technology of the present has already crossed privacy boundaries, Mike Weston of the WSJ says the difference is that future &#8216;smart&#8217; cities will allow our information to be much more &#8220;centralized and easy to access.&#8221; Private businesses who pay to create the smart cities will look to make up for their expenses by selling the valuable information they gather to other entities like marketers.</p>
<p>The inevitability of our information being sold to make a profit is unavoidable and laws and regulations can only do so much. Therefore, the ethical issue businesses face is to what degree the collection of personal information and of targeting individuals using their personal information considered a violation of privacy. Weston predicts that if businesses don&#8217;t act responsibly with the information, there will be public backlash and a loss of business for those entities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.huilab.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/student-biometric.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-354" src="http://www.huilab.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/student-biometric-300x300.jpg" alt="student+biometric" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, new lawsuits against social media giant, Facebook, deal with the collection of data through user&#8217;s uploaded pictures. Facebook has the ability to take your face in a picture and turn it into &#8220;a unique number,&#8221; allowing the social media site to identify you in other pictures and allow other users to &#8220;tag&#8221; you and view other pictures you&#8217;ve been &#8220;tagged&#8221; in. This practice has broken laws in multiple states that give residents rights when their biometric information is collected.</p>
<p>The use of facial recognition technology is a cause for concern on the issues of both personal privacy and identity theft. One expert on the issue states, &#8220;Facial recognition lets people you never met and never heard of identify you from far away without your knowledge or permission.&#8221; Action to place more effective boundaries on facial recognition technology seems fruitless thus far, with many companies unwilling to &#8220;promise not to use facial recognition on random passersby in public places.&#8221;</p>

<p>A list compiled by the popular career community website, Glassdoor, names 25 of the best U.S. cities to move to for a good salary and place to live. Analysts at Glassdoor compiled the list using a measure of the cost of living, the number of job openings from data gathered through their users, as well as how satisfied those users were at their jobs. The article by the Washington Post identifies interesting insights and potential flaws of the list and makes the point that we have a less mobile workforce combined with opportunities for work located in areas where the people out of work are not.</p>

<p>A current article from Government Technology discusses the best and most popular smart city resources, provides an overall status of the industry, and an overview of smart city trends. Popular resources include advisory sources like Gartner and Forester, the Smart Cities Council, and many more. The growth of the smart cities technology industry is accelerating as told by IHS forecasts which predict that the industry will be worth $1.656 trillion by 2020. Finally, the growth of the industry also comes with significant risks, including the trending issue of weak smart city, cyber-security.</p>

<p>According to Government Technology, on April 20, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced the launch of ‘What Works Cities,’ a $42 million three-year initiative that will assist mid-sized American cities in developing data projects that improve life for their residents. Technology-minded mayors and IT leaders of cities will receive guidance from organizations like The Behavioral Performance Lab, Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Government Excellence, Results for America and the Sunlight Foundation in successfully completing and carrying out their projects.</p>
<p>Exciting projects are in the works already including a travel-planning app in Albuquerque, N.M. that reduces transit-related calls by 25% and data coordination software in New Orleans, which reduces urban disfigurement by 10,000 residences. Bloomberg is planning to invite 285 cities total to participate in their data innovation initiative.</p>
